### Traffic Simulation using JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas

#### Overview

This project simulates traffic on a road network using JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. The simulation incorporates various real-world elements such as vehicles, potholes, bus stops, lane closures, and traffic flow rates (vehicles per hour). This allows for realistic modeling of traffic behavior on different lanes under varying road conditions.

#### Features

- **Vehicles per Hour**: Control the number of vehicles entering the road network, adjusting traffic density dynamically.
- **Potholes**: Potholes are randomly generated or manually added to lanes, affecting vehicle speed and lane choices.
- **Bus Stops**: Vehicles may stop at bus stops for a certain duration, simulating public transport delays.
- **Lane Closures**: Simulate roadwork or accidents that result in the closure of one or more lanes, forcing vehicles to reroute or change lanes.
- **Lane Changing for overtaking**: Simulate change lanes and overtaking when vehicles ahead are going slow.

#### Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: The core simulation logic is written in JavaScript.
- **HTML5 Canvas**: Used for rendering the road network and vehicles.
- **CSS**: Basic styling for the simulation interface (if applicable).

#### Future Enhancements

- **Dynamic Weather Conditions**: Introduce weather elements (rain, fog, etc.) that affect visibility and vehicle speeds.
- **Collision Detection**: Add realistic collisions between vehicles during heavy traffic or lane changes.
- **More Vehicle Types**: Add different types of vehicles (trucks, buses, etc.) with varying speeds and behavior.
